Summary: Introducing thinkcube: Play

One of these times it occured to me that we do not have an engineering blog. A place where we write about the cool stuff we do, the problems we face in the process and how we overcome those. Like anyone of you, when we find ourselves stuck somewhere with our work we get on the internet and look around whether someone has a solution for that. And we often find one thanks to all those people who blog about their experience and share their knowledge in all sorts of forums and Q&A sites. That is really awesome and we should totally help make things more awesome for everyone. Hence this blog.

Why play?

Why not? We really enjoy a lot of the stuff we do, so it's almost like play for us. Hence the name.

We are here to share, hoping someone somewhere will find our little place on the internet is worth the moments they spare.
